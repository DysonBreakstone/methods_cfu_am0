# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

1. I feel fairly confident! There are a lot of them, and I don't even begin to understand many of them, but I feel confident that as we learn more about Ruby a lot of the language will start to make more sense. 

2. I feel okay with writing simple methods! I have a feeling there's going to be a lot more to learn in this area, I'm just starting to get a feeling for the depth of what this language is capable of. 

3. I am wondering how we write methods that interact the variable calling them. As in, how do I write a method that I can call like this? `my_variable.my_method`
